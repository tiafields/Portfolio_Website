            <p>Last year I started working at a dog grooming shop part-time where they offer daycare and boarding.
                Many clients want their furry friends to have more attention than the facility can offer. I 
                took this as an opportunity to create a business card and started dog-sitting on the side.
            </p>

            <p>My client list grew so large that I could not remember the specific details for each dog.
                a web application that helps dog sitters keep track of their clients' and furry friends' data. </p>
            </p>

            <p>This application allows the user to fill out a form with all the information necessary to take care
                of the dogs. It will then
                add the form to a collection of all the dogs the user has acquired. Listing all the clients you have
                on a separate page. You can then delete the dog's data afterward. </p>

            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Often pet owners go on vacation, and instead of boarding their pets they search for a house sitter to keep their animal in a familiar, comfortable environment. Many dog sitters can have several clients and need a way to log this information, as well as contact clients, and maintain their dog sitting schedule.</p>
            <p>For this project, I designed an app to allow pet sitters to log and maintain data of all of their canines and clients. This application will also allow the pet sitter to create and maintain a schedule of all the dogs they are watching, and have in-app messaging to allow the user to contact the client if necessary.</p>
            <p>How might we help dog sitters:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Log and maintain data of canines and clients</li>
                <li>Keep track of which dogs they are sitting and when</li>
                <li>Contact clients through a messaging system</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="longform-quote">What features and design aspects have competitors excelled in, and what can they improve on?</p>
            <p>All applications are used for scheduling dogs or house sitters. Most applications provide similar features, but the main difference is in services provided by the applications. Each application is missing features for an independent dog sitter. Below are features that could benefit the application.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Scheduling</b>: This can help the sitter keep track of dates and exterminate overlap with other clients.</li>
                <li><b>Dog details page with visualization</b>: Graphics can help the user feel less overwhelmed with words and content.</li>
                <li><b>Searchable database</b>: This will make it easier for the sitter to search clients and dogs.</li>
                <li><b>Color scheme to match branding</b>: Creating an application with a thoughtful color scheme to match the brand will help reinforce and distinguish the brand identity.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>NEEDS/WANTS: An application that has an internal schedule builder and messaging system, that notes the details of the Veterinary information, and a reminder section to note when the dog-sitting gigs are.</li>
                <li>PAIN POINTS: Applications do not allow for events unrelated to the dog gigs, a place for notes for clients, or applications that take too much commission for dog gigs.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>A different color scheme into the application. I altered the text color to match flow and energy of the application making it more intriguing and playful.</li>
                <li>I imported images and applied accent colors to buttons and backgrounds of images  throughout the application </li>
                <li>I separated the canine information into categories. This made the different information sections more readable to the user.</li>
                <li>I also applied icons throughout the canine information page to make the different categories easily identifiable. </li>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>
                This is one of my biggest passion projects. It is not only a useful application for myself but for other dog sitters wishing to expand their business. One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that I was considering user needs and not just designing an application for myself. I consulted several of my friends, their siblings, and co-workers who also dog sit and I had to prioritize their needs and wants, to develop features that would work well for all users. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A new skill I have acquired while working on this project is how to make an application interactive. I have prototyped before in Figma, but I have never utilized their tools to create an interactive prototype. Working on this application allowed me to evolve my skill set and improve my knowledge of Figma interactions. Having the ability to simulate the gestures of an application helps bring the application to life and makes it feel closer to a finished product.

                If I were to continue to expand this project I would like to build out the details on the settings page. Providing legitimate options for account information, notifications, and changing the password. I would also like to expand my knowledge on interaction and built-in dropdown options for filtering content and profile expansion.
